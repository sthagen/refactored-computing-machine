* crypto - hashing, signing, and signature validation
* extension - sets of elements mandatory in addition to baseline
* fuzz - generate surrogate and poisoned SBOMs
* merge - an SBOM with other SBOMs or additional information
* mock - provide optimal testability
* policy - to apply
* produce - an SBOM
* report - anything from produce, transform, and consume
* rule - executing policies
* transform - and SBOM into another SBOM
